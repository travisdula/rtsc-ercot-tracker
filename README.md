# rtsc-ercot-tracker
## Purpose
Around the middle of February 2021, we were hit with unusually bad winter weather.
Texas, my home state, seemed to be suffering the worst.
Our grid is not designed for such cold weather, and it typically performs maintenance on its power generation in the winter, when demand is normally lower.
Due to the very cold weather, demand was higher than production, so it became a topic of interest how the power grid was holding up.
So, I created this, to track the power grid's supply and demand, then plot the produced JSON data.

## Dependencies
* `matplotlib` `beautifulsoup4`

## TODO
 * More precise error handling
 * More plotting control
 * Better time display
 * More flexible about JSON names
